# ü¶¥ Knee Osteoarthritis Risk Assessment System

üîó **Live Deployment**: [https://osteo-care.onrender.com](https://osteo-care-qctw.onrender.com))

---

## üåü About the Project

**OsteoCare** is an AI-driven web application designed to assist in the early detection and severity assessment of **knee osteoarthritis**. The platform supports two diagnostic modes:

* **X-ray Image Classification** for Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading
* **Clinical Questionnaire** for risk assessment

This dual-mode system ensures that individuals without access to radiological imaging can still get personalized insights via a simple form.

---

## üåü Aim

To build an accessible and intelligent osteoarthritis screening system that can:

* Detect and classify OA severity from X-ray images.
* Offer clinical risk assessment without imaging.
* Provide instant feedback to assist early intervention.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Scope

* Dual diagnostic approach: Image + Questionnaire
* Bilingual interface (English/Hindi)
* Real-time predictions
* Personalized user experience
* Google Drive model integration for efficient deployment

## üåç Deployment Notes

* Hosted on **Render** (Free Tier)
* Models are not bundled in the repo due to large size
* **Google Drive** is used for on-the-fly model loading

## üîí Security Best Practices

* Use `.env` to store your `SECRET_KEY` and sensitive info
* Never hardcode secrets in source files (e.g., `app.py`)
